# OpenKHS #
Free open source KHS (Kingdom Hall Scheduling) application. Totally free - no "donations"!

Currently just a work in progress. Heavily leverages patterns for loose coupling to allow for testing and future extensibility.

Feel free to have a look at the code by cloning this repository using:

* `git clone https://github.com/savaged/OpenKHS.git OpenKHS`


## TO DO List ##
* Functional Requirement: Add cleaning schedule
* NFR: Simplify model to flat objects that can be passed to the gateway as a data Dictionary
